## Section Breakdown

Below is an explanation of each section of a tutorial. You can have as many concepts and sub-concept headings as needed. For example purposes, the section breakdown will only use two sub-concepts.

| Section                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Title                   | The name assigned to the tutorial. Aim for a title that is no longer than five words.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Intro Body              | The introduction sets the context for the tutorial and explains the challenge. The introduction must also provide the user with an explanation of what they will learn in this tutorial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Prerequisites           | List out the required software or hardware the practitioner is required to have installed and available in order to complete the tutorial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
| [Concept]               | The title of one of main concepts of the tutorial. This can potentially be one out of several main concepts.  Example - “Configure the Environment”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [Sub-Concept]           | The tile of a child concept that stems from the parent concept.  Example - “Create Secondary Cluster” OR “App Model  Overview”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Cleanup                 | All tutorials should ideally be deployed through infrastructure as code (IaC), if applicable.  All resources deployed by the tutorial should be removed. It is our responsibility to help and provide guidance to the user on how to remove all resources. Sometimes this section is brief with a simple command such as `terraform destroy -auto-approve`                                                                                                  |
| Next Steps              | This section summarizes the key learning concepts and the actions the practitioner conducted. Additionally, this section should link to or suggest the next set of topics that the practitioner can dive into.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
